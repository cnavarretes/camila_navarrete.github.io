collection: publications
excerpt: Navarrete, C., Belokurov, V., Koposov, S. E., ApJL, 841, L23. We report the discovery of tidal tails around the Galactic globular cluster NGC 7492, based on the Data Release 1 of the Pan-STARRS1 survey. The tails were detected using a version of the matched filter technique applied to the (g−r, r) and (g−i, i) color–magnitude diagrams. Tidal tails emerging from the cluster extend at least ∼3.5deg in the north–east to south–east direction, equivalent to ∼1.5 kpc in projected length.
